## Robot Purpose

YEETBot3000 is a robot designed to interact with humans who are using the ICRS (Imperial College Robotics Society) lab. A particular problem the ICRS committee have is that many people do not return tools to the correct places, instead opting to leave them out (or worse, lose them). YEETBot3000 aims to discover whether a human centred robot can improve the return rate of tools, and how much of an effect different styles of robot-human interaction have on tool return rate.
